# Getting started with Tomcat on Bluemix
{: #getting_started}

* {: download} Congratulations, you deployed a Hello World sample application on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}!  To get started, follow this step-by-step guide. Or, <a class="xref" href="http://bluemix.net" target="_blank" title="(Download sample code)"><img class="hidden" src="../../images/btn_starter-code.svg" alt="Download application code" />download the sample code</a> and explore on your own.

By following this guide, you'll set up a development environment, deploy an app locally and on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, and integrate a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} database service in your app.

## Prerequisites
{: #prereqs}

You'll need the following:
* [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/)
* [Cloud Foundry CLI ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads){: new_window}
* [Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/neon2){: new_window}
* [Git ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://git-scm.com/downloads){: new_window}
* [Maven ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi){: new_window}
* [Apache Tomcat version 8.0.41 ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi#8.0.41 ){: new_window}


## 1. Clone the sample app
{: #clone}

Now you're ready to start working with the sample Tomcat app. Clone the repository and change to the directory to where the sample app is located.
```
git clone https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/get-started-tomcat
```
{: pre}

```
cd get-started-tomcat
```
{: pre}

Peruse the files in the *get-started-tomcat* directory to familiarize yourself with the contents.

## 2. Run the app locally
{: #run_locally}

You must install the dependencies and build a .war file as defined in the pom.xml file to run the app.

Install the dependencies.

```
mvn clean install  
```
{: pre}


Copy GetStartedTomcat.war from the `target` directory into your `tomcat-install-dir` `webapps` directory.

Run the app.  
```
<tomcat-install-dir>/bin/startup.bat|.sh
```
{: screen}

View your app at: http://localhost:8080/GetStartedTomcat/

Use `shutdown.bat|.sh` to stop your app.  Note you may need to give the commands execute permission.
{: tip}

## 3. Prepare the app for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} deployment
{: #prepare}

To deploy to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, it can be helpful to set up a manifest.yml file. The manifest.yml includes basic information about your app, such as the name, how much memory to allocate for each instance and the route. We've provided a sample manifest.yml file in the `get-started-tomcat` directory.

Open the manifest.yml file, and change the `name` from `GetStartedTomcat` to your app name, <var class="keyword varname" data-hd-keyref="app_name">app_name</var>.
{: download}

  ```
  applications:
  - name: GetStartedTomcat
    random-route: true
    memory: 256M
    path: target/GetStartedTomcat.war
    buildpack: java_buildpack
  ```
  {: codeblock}

In this manifest.yml file, **random-route: true** generates a random route for your app to prevent your route from colliding with others.  If you choose to, you can replace **random-route: true** with **host: myChosenHostName**, supplying a host name of your choice. [Learn more...](/docs/manageapps/depapps.html#appmanifest)
{: tip}

## 4. Deploy the app
{: #deploy}

You can use the Cloud Foundry CLI to deploy apps.

Choose your API endpoint

```
cf api <API-endpoint>
```
{:pre}

Replace the *API-endpoint* in the command with an API endpoint from the following list.

|URL                             |Region          |
|:-------------------------------|:---------------|
| https://api.ng.bluemix.net     | US South       |
| https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net  | United Kingdom |
| https://api.au-syd.bluemix.net | Sydney         |


Login to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account:

```
cf login
```
{: pre}

From within the *get-started-tomcat* directory push your app to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
```
cf push
```
{: pre}

This can take around two minutes. If there is an error in the deployment process you can use the command `cf logs <Your-App-Name> --recent` to troubleshoot.

When deployment completes you should see a message indicating that your app is running.  View your app at the URL listed in the output of the push command.  You can also issue the
  ```
cf apps
  ```
  {: pre}
  command to view your apps status and see the URL.

## 6. Developing in Eclipse
{: #developing_in_eclipse}

IBMÂ® Eclipse Tools for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} provides plug-ins that can be installed into an existing Eclipse environment to assist in integrating the developer's integrated development environment (IDE) with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

Download and install  [IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/tools-IBM_Eclipse_Tools_for_Bluemix).

Import this sample into Eclipse using `File` -> `Import` -> `Maven` -> `Existing Maven Projects` option.

Create a Tomcat server definition:
  - In the `Servers` view right-click -> `New` -> `Server`.
  - Select `Apache` -> `Tomcat v8.0 Server`.
  - Choose your `tomcat-install-dir`.
  - Continue the wizard with default options to Finish.

Run your application locally on the Apache server:
  - Right click on the `GetStartedTomcat` sample and select `Run As` -> `Run on Server` option.
  - Find and select the localhost Tomcat server and press Finish.
  - In a few seconds, your application should be running at http://localhost:8080/GetStartedTomcat/

Create a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} server definition:
  - In the `Servers` view, right-click -> `New` -> `Server`.
  - Select `IBM` -> `IBM Bluemix` and follow the steps in the wizard.
  - Enter your credentials and click `Next`
  - Select your `org` and `space` and click `Finish`

Run your application on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}:
  - Right click on the `GetStartedTomcat` sample and select `Run As` -> `Run on Server` option.
  - Find and select the `IBM Bluemix` and press Finish.
  - A wizard will guide you with the deployment options. Be sure to choose a unique `Name` for your application.
  - In a few minutes, your application should be running at the URL you chose.

Now you have run your code locally and on the cloud!

## 7. Add a database
{: #add_database}

Next, we'll add a NoSQL database to this application and set up the application so that it can run locally and on Bluemix.

1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} in your Browser. Browse to the `Dashboard`. Select your application by clicking on its name in the `Name` column.
2. Click on `Connections` then `Connect new`.
2. In the `Data & Analytics` section, select `Cloudant NoSQL DB` and `Create` the service.
3. Select `Restage` when prompted. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} will restart your application and provide the database credentials to your application using the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. This environment variable is only available to the application when it is running on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

Environment variables enable you to separate deployment settings from your source code. For example, instead of hardcoding a database password, you can store this in an environment variable which you reference in your source code. [Learn more...](/docs/manageapps/depapps.html#app_env)
{: tip}

## 8. Use the database
{: #use_database}
We're now going to update your local code to point to this database. We'll store the credentials for the services in a properties file. This file will get used ONLY when the application is running locally. When running in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, the credentials will be read from the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable.

1. Open Eclipse and open the file src/main/resources/cloudant.properties:
  ```
  cloudant_url=
  ```
  {: pre}

2. In your browser open the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI, select your App -> Connections -> Cloudant -> View Credentials

3. Copy and paste just the `url` from the credentials to the `url` field of the `cloudant.properties` file and save the changes.  The result will be something like:
  ```
  cloudant_url=https://123456789 ... bluemix.cloudant.com
  ```

4. Restart Tomcat server in Eclipse from the `Servers` view.

  Refresh your browser view at: http://localhost:8080/GetStartedTomcat/. Any names you enter into the app will now get added to the database.

  Your local app and the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} app are sharing the database.  View your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} app at the URL listed in the output of the push command from above.  Names you add from either app should appear in both when you refresh the browsers.

Remember if you don't need your app live on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, stop it so you don't incur any unexpected charges.
